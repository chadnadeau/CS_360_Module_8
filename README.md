# CS_360_Module_8

* The application I developed was for warehouse workers to track and update their inventory directly from the application. The application needed to be able to house user information in a database for logging in, house inventory information in a database for viewing, adding, deleting and updating.

* The screens that needed to be implemented were a log in screen with the ability to create a user account and have it stored in the database. Once the user was logged in, they were shown the current inventory and all of the data that went along with it such as name, quantity and price. The user was also given an edit button which would give them the options to update the inventory as mentioned previously. This design was successful because it was simple in design and easy to use.

* My process for coding the app was to first get the layout for each page and then integrate each page to work together correctly. I believe the approach I had would have been successful if I was able to dedicate more time to the project and finish. I would like to think this strategy would be beneficial in future endeavors because it first gives me a look at how everything should work when it is all finished.

* To test the functionality, I would make small changes to see if it gave me the desired outcome and then run the emulator to make sure it was correct. I did have to use Logcat several times as well to find out why the application wasn't launching, which in the end, helped me out a lot.

* I had to innovate several times using Logcat. When the application would force close or give an on screen error in the emulator, you aren't provided with the error directly. Using Logcat helped out immensely with narrowing down the issue and correcting it so the application would function.

* The log in screen/account creation were the only thing I was really able to finish. There were several tweaks that could be made but I was able to get it to check with the database if a user had been created.
