# CS_360_Module_8

### The application I developed was for warehouse workers to track and update their inventory directly from the application. The application needed to be able to house user information in a database for logging in, house inventory information in a database for viewing, adding, deleting and updating.

## The screens that needed to be implemented were a log in screen with the ability to create a user account and have it stored in the database. Once the user was logged in, they were shown the current inventory and all of the data that went along with it such as name, quantity and price. The user was also given an edit button which would give them the options to update the inventory as mentioned previously. This design was successful because it was simple in design and easy to use.
